      <h3>Summary (200–250 words)</h3>
      <p>Western Europe was told “92 drones entered Poland.” In reality, fewer than two dozen crossed, a handful crashed, damage trivial, and attribution remains murky. Yet pundits cried “Article 5!” as if tanks had rolled into Berlin.</p>
      <p>This panic isn’t about facts. It’s about Europe’s role as a stage for other powers’ scripts. Russia fractures Europe with provocations; Washington binds Europe with dependency. Migration politics mirror the same trick: in the Netherlands, Poles and Ukrainians drive the largest inflows, not African or Middle Eastern asylum seekers. Yet asylum dominates headlines, while the real demographic shifts tied to EU free movement and the Ukraine war remain unspoken. The result: Europe is financially drained, socially fractured, and politically divided.</p>
      <p>The “92 drones” weren’t an attack on Amsterdam — they were a probe in Poland. But the hysteria shows the truth: until Europe separates deterrence from drama, it will remain a pawn, not a player.</p>

      “The ‘92 drones’ over Poland weren’t an attack on Amsterdam — they were a probe turned into hysteria. Moscow exploits the fractures, Washington exploits the dependency, and Europe pays the bill while losing its sovereignty.”
    </blockquote>

    <article>
      <p>When headlines screamed “92 drones entered Polish airspace” this September, Western Europe panicked. Commentators warned “Article 5! NATO is under attack!” Social media lit up with memes of World War III. In Dutch cafés and German beer halls, ordinary citizens repeated the line: “our borders are under attack.”</p>
      <p>But were they? Strip away the hysteria and the picture looks different. NATO officials later confirmed only 19–23 drones actually crossed into Poland. A handful crashed; one hit a roof. Damage was minor. No one died. Prosecutors logged nine incidents of debris, but attribution remains murky. Yet the “92” figure — inflated, unverified — was enough to set off a chorus of fear across Europe.</p>
      <p>This was not an armed attack on Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or Zurich. It was a probe in eastern Poland. And yet it was treated as if NATO itself had been invaded. Why? Because Europe has been trained — by both Washington and Moscow — to panic at every spark, even when the fire is small.</p>

      <h2>2014: the hinge moment</h2>
      <p>To understand how we got here, we need to go back to 2014. Ukraine’s elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled after months of protest and Western-backed maneuvering. For Washington, it was a democratic uprising. For Moscow, it was a U.S.-engineered coup — with then–Vice President Joe Biden and State Department officials visibly shaping the outcome.</p>
      <p>Whatever the framing, the consequences were clear. Russia seized Crimea. War erupted in the Donbas. Europe imposed sanctions but kept importing Russian gas. The Minsk accords were signed but never honored. For a while, the conflict was treated as a regional fire to be contained, not as “our borders under attack.”</p>

      <h2>2022: war without occupation</h2>
      <p>When Russian troops crossed Ukraine’s borders in February 2022, Western leaders rushed to call it a “full-scale invasion.” But compare it with Iraq 2003 or Afghanistan 2001. Those were true full-country occupations.</p>
      <p>Russia’s campaign was different. It pushed columns toward Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson, but lacked the logistics for permanent control. Just as George H.W. Bush stopped short of Baghdad in 1991 after liberating Kuwait, Moscow pulled back from Kyiv once regime collapse didn’t materialize. The deeper objective was clearer: secure Donbas, establish a land corridor to Crimea, force political concessions.</p>
      <p>Western intelligence hyped a plan for total conquest. Russian officials spoke of “demilitarization” and “denazification,” deliberately vague. The truth lies somewhere in between: maximalist hopes combined with minimalist fallback. It was a major military campaign, but not a bid to occupy the whole country.</p>

      <h2>Washington’s dependency trap</h2>
      <p>Here the United States found its leverage. Trump had already called NATO “obsolete,” demanding Europe pay more. His second coming only sharpened the point: America would not carry Europe’s defense on its back.</p>
      <p>So Europe opened its wallet — and bought American. Patriots, HIMARS, F-35s. Old kit was sent to Ukraine, new kit ordered from Lockheed and Raytheon. Gas once piped from Russia was replaced with expensive American LNG. Europe was “taking responsibility,” but becoming more dependent than ever on U.S. weapons and energy.</p>
      <p>For Washington, it was perfect. Russia’s army bled on Ukrainian soil. European taxpayers funded the war effort and U.S. defense industry at the same time. And NATO cohesion was renewed, not through persuasion but through fear.</p>

      <h2>Moscow’s fracture game</h2>
      <p>Russia, for its part, leaned into ambiguity. Drone swarms, missile spillovers, border skirmishes, cyber pokes. None quite catastrophic enough to trigger Article 5. All guaranteed to spark hysteria.</p>
      <p>Each provocation splits European publics. On one side: the cry wolfers shouting “our borders, our Article 5, escalate now!” On the other: the balanced camp asking “why pour billions into endless war, death, and destruction? Shouldn’t we talk?”</p>
      <p>Moscow doesn’t need to “win” Ukraine outright. It only needs to keep Europe financially drained, socially fractured, and politically divided.</p>

      <h2>The “92 drones” moment as case study</h2>
      <p>That’s exactly what happened in September 2025. Ninety-two became the magic number, even though fewer than two dozen drones crossed Poland. No lives lost, minimal damage, attribution uncertain — yet pundits invoked Article 5 as if tanks had rolled into Berlin.</p>
      <p>NATO leadership knew better. Article 5 has only ever been triggered once — after 9/11, an unambiguous armed attack. This drone episode merited Article 4 consultations and quiet reinforcement, nothing more. But the public wave had already done its work: fear spread, budgets rose, dependency deepened.</p>

      <h2>The other “cry wolf”: migration</h2>
      <p>If drone panic is one lever, migration is another. And here too, the story told in Western Europe doesn’t match the numbers.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, the loudest alarms are about asylum seekers from Syria, Eritrea, or Afghanistan. Images of dinghies in the Mediterranean fuel right-wing outrage. But official data show the real migration story: the largest inflows for decades have been Polish workers (since EU accession in 2004) and Ukrainians (especially after 2014, and then exploding after 2022).</p>
      <p>By 2023, Ukrainians were among the largest foreign-born arrivals in the Netherlands. Compared to that, African and Middle Eastern asylum numbers pale. Yet asylum dominates headlines, while Eastern European migration quietly reshapes housing, labor markets, and public services.</p>
      <p>This too is a form of cry wolf politics: citizens are mobilized emotionally against “outsiders” in boats, while the real demographic shifts — tied to EU free movement and the Ukraine war — go unspoken. And here again, the same countries at the center of the drone panic, Poland and Ukraine, are also at the heart of Europe’s migration surge.</p>

      <h2>Two cries, one outcome</h2>
      <p>Security panic (“our borders!”) and migration panic (“our culture!”) function the same way. Both inflate threats selectively. Both channel fear into policy. And both produce the same effect: a continent more anxious, more fractured, easier to manipulate from outside.</p>

      <h2>Europe’s double bind</h2>
      <p>It’s comforting to say only Moscow wants to weaken Europe. But the harder truth is that Washington has no interest in a truly independent Europe either.</p>
      <p>— Moscow’s strategy is cheap ambiguity: small probes that sow division.<br>
      — Washington’s strategy is dependency: arms sales, LNG exports, “unity” enforced by fear.</p>
      <p>Moscow fractures Europe with uncertainty. Washington contains Europe with dependency. Both leave Europe weaker, poorer, and less sovereign.</p>

      <h2>From stage to actor</h2>
      <p>That is Europe’s real tragedy. It is not the protagonist of this drama — it is the stage. Its citizens are told to panic at every drone, every migrant, every headline. Its leaders indulge in emotional theater about “our borders,” when Amsterdam’s borders are not under fire at all. Its wealth is siphoned into wars it cannot end and industries it does not control.</p>
      <p>If Europe wants to break the cycle, it must separate deterrence from drama. Harden its air defenses without crying Article 5 every month. Invest in its own arms and energy industries, not just buy American. Re-open diplomacy with Russia, not as appeasement, but as recognition that endless war bleeds Europe more than it bleeds Washington.</p>

      <h2>The uncomfortable conclusion</h2>
      <p>The “92 drones” were never an attack on Rotterdam. They were a probe in eastern Poland, inflated into hysteria. But the reaction tells the real story: Europe has become a theater for other powers’ scripts.</p>
      <p>Until Europe confronts the double bind — that Moscow profits from its fractures and Washington profits from its dependence — every drone, every migrant, every headline will push it deeper into crisis.</p>
