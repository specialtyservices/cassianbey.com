      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Exploration</strong> — diving into history, culture, names, language, identity, and hidden connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Observation</strong> — noticing details others miss, addressing and archiving them as part of a bigger story.</li>
        <li><strong>Translation</strong> — turning complexity into simple insights that are easy to grasp.</li>
        <li><strong>Storytelling</strong> — writing, speaking, and creating narratives that make sense of tangled realities.</li>
